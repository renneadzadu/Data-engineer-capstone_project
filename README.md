# Data Engineer Capstone Project

## Requirements Document


### Overview: 
This Capstone Project requires learners to work with the following technologies to manage an ETL process for a Loan Application dataset and a Credit Card dataset: Python (Pandas, advanced modules, e.g., Matplotlib), SQL, Apache Spark (Spark Core, Spark SQL), and Python Visualization and Analytics libraries. Learners are expected to set up their environments and perform installations on their local machines.

# 2. Functional Requirements - Application Front-End 
Once data is loaded into the database, we need a front-end (console) to see/display data. For that, create a console-based Python program to satisfy System Requirements 2 (2.1 and 2.2). 
##  2.1 Transaction Details Module - 2.2 Customer Details Module

## 3. Functional Requirements - Data Analysis and Visualization
After data is loaded into the database, users can make changes from the front end, and they can also view data from the front end. Now, the business analyst team wants to analyze and visualize the data.
Use Python libraries for the below requirements:
